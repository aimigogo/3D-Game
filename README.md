# Design-creating an application for the diagnosis of mental disorders using the Prolog language

Welcome to the repository for the diagnostic application developed as part of a thesis project focused on the detection of psychological diseases. This application is designed and implemented using the Prolog language and the Visual Prolog 10 IDE programming environment.

# Features
Implementation of diagnostic algorithms for psychological disease detection
Utilization of UML and ER design for application development
Analysis of code using decision trees and Visual Prolog

# Installation

1.Download or clone this repository.
2.Open the uowmThesis folder.
3.Open the exe folder.
4.Right click on the Application icon.
5.Run as Administrator.
